## Overview

The greet module exports the named function hello.
The arithmetic module exports an object to which two methods are attached, add and sub.

The hello function has an arity of 1 which should be a string. The output for a valid string is the string concatenated after 'hello '. If a non string is passed in as the argument the function returns null.

The add method has an arity of 2 which should both be numbers. The output for valid numbers is the sum of the two numbers. If a non number is passed in as either of the arguments the method returns null.

The sub method has an arity of 2 which should both be numbers. The output for valid numbers is the 2nd argument subtracted from the first argument. If a non number is passed in as either of the arguments the method returns null.
