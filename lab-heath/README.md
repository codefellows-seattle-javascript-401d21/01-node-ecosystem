##401 lab-1

i have a function called hello() that will build a string that will do "hello 'arguments'"

i also have a test for the hello which will run and see if the results will be what i expect. this is called when i write greet.hello()

I also have a function for the arithmetic.js fill called sum() and sub()

#sum
it will return 'null' if they don't have a valid number and then will add both arguments and returns the value.

#sub
it will return 'null' if they don't have a valid number and then will subtract the arguments and returns the value.

i have a test for both that will test and see if that is what i get.
