This lab was an exploration in to TDD (test driven development). Our task was to utilize the Jest NPM package with proper setup and installation to test the output behavior of modules included in the lib/ directory. In both of these lib/ directory files, we are exporting an 'exports' object (initially set of be an empty object literal) that we can assign expressions to that will become available in other files by using the 'require(../lib/xxx)' syntax in those respective files.

The arithmetic module has two very simple functions, basic addition and subtraction. For both functions, there is an expectation of two parameters, both integers. If either of the given parameters are not integers, the function will return a value of null. If both parameters are integers, the functions will return the sum of the two integers or the value of the first integer less the second, respectively.

The greet module has only one function, greet, which expects a single string as a parameter. If the given parameter is not a string, the function will return null. If the parameter is a string, the function will return that string following the word 'hello' and a space. (e.g. 'amy' => 'hello amy')
