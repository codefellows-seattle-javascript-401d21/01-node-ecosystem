#### Greet Module
The greet module contains the function greet, which takes in one parameter that is expected to be a string. It outputs "hello " concactenated with the argument passed in. If the argument passed in is not a string or is a blank string, it returns null.

#### Arithmetic Module
The arithmetic module contains two functions, add and sub. They are both expected to have two parameters with expected data type of number. The add function adds the two arguments, while the sub function subtracts the first argument from the second one. If either or both of the arguments are not numbers, the functions will return null.
