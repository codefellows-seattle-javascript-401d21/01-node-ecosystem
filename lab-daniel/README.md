Greet Module Exports:

  The only method being exported by the greet module is the hello method. This method takes in a single argument in the form of a string.
  The expected returned value includes 'hello' and the string passed as an argument. (ex: passing ('world') should return 'hello world')
  If passed anything other than a single string the method returns null.

Arithmetic Module Exports:

  The first method being exported by the arithmetic module is the add method. This method takes in two arguments in the form of numbers.
  The expected returned value is the sum of both numbers passed as arguments. (ex: passing (1, 1) should return 2 because 1 + 1 = 2)
  If passed anything other than a pair of numbers the method returns null.

  The second method being exported by the arithmetic module is the sub method. This method takes in two arguments int he form of numbers.
  The expected returned value is the difference of both numbers passed as arguments. (ex: passing (1, 1) should return 0 because 1 - 1 = 0)
  If passed anything other than a pair of numbers the method returns null.
